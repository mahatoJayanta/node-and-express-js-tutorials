 npm init
    
     This utility will walk you through creating a package.json 
    
     file.
    
     It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

    
     See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
    
     and exactly what they do.

    
     Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package andsave it as a dependency in the package.json file.

    
     Press ^C at any time to quit.
